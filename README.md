Phase 1 Project: Soccer Fanatasy Team
Welcome to our soccer fanatasy team page!

The website lists a few of our current favorite players and their game statistics. The players are displayed in the form of cards on the website. The cards include the name, image and number of goals scored this season. There's a button to add goals on the cards as well, as soccer games progress. Don't see your favorite players? No worries, we added a form on the left hand side of the website so users will be able to add players by prividing a name and URL for that player. When the form is submitted, a new player card is generated at the end of the roster. Goals can be added to the new players as well. To keep track of the games, there's a menu on the left under the submit form that lists the two teams playing as well as goals scored. We hope you enjoy your experience!
